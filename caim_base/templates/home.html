    <p>
      Caim is in its early stages of growth and is continuously expanding to new locations. 
      Currently, we only have partners who operate in parts of CO and TX. 
      If you aren't located in one of these areas but still want to foster, check out our 
      <a href="https://www.caim.org/rescue-directory">Rescue Directory</a>
      to find a shelter or rescue near you.
    </p><p>
      If you're a shelter or rescue anywhere in the US who wants to use our platform, please sign up for an organization account. 
      You must first create an <a href="https://app.caim.org/register">individual user account</a> before you can request an <a href="https://app.caim.org/organization/apply">organization account</a>. 
      We review and approve all organization account requests within 2 business days. You can upload animals in the meantime, but they won't be available for view by the public until we've changed your org account to Active. 
    </p><p>
      If you have questions, please check out our <a href="https://www.caim.org/faq">FAQs</a> or email us at hello@caim.org.
